    <h2>Ingredients (yields about 36 cookies)</h2>

        <li>285 g unsalted butter, room temp (about 2 sticks) OR 214 g vegetable oil (about a cup)</li>
        <li>230 g granulated sugar (about a cup)</li>
        <li>285 g dark brown sugar (about 1.33 cups)</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temp</li>
        <li>470 g all-purpose flour (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp fine salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>450g (1lb) dark chocolate discs/wafers</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Prep ingredients so they are room temp (eggs, butter)
        </li>

        <li>
            Place flour (470g) and salt (1.5 tsp) in a large mixing bowl. Sift baking powder (1.5 tsp)
            and baking soda (1.25 tsp) through a small sieve into the flour.
        </li>

        <li>
            Whisk everything together until well mixed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Soften room temp butter (285g) or vegetable oil (214g). Add brown (285g)
            and white (230g) sugar and mix on medium speed until the colour islightened
            and the mixture looks fluffy.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Add vanilla (2 tsp) and room temp eggs (2), then until just well incorporated,
            scraping down sides as needed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add dry ingredients in 4 installments, mixing just for a few seconds each time until the
            flour is no longer sitting on top of the dough. Use a wooden spoon to stir everything together.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the chocolate discs then continue to mix on low speed just until all the flour is
            incorporated into the dough and the chocolate is evenly distributed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Portion the dough out into 2-inch balls and place them onto a tray or a big container.
            This is about 1.22 oz.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate for 48 hours.
        </li>

        <li>
            When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F. Let it preheat for at least 30 minutes. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Once the oven is ready, pull cookies out and put them on baking sheets lined with parchment
            paper or silicone mat. Make sure the cookies are at least 2 inches apart
            (you should only put 6 cookies on a half sheet pan).
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake only 1 cookie to test out.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the middle rack for 15 mins until the edges are golden brown but the centre is still soft.
            **If after your first batch you find that the cookies are spreading too much, increase the temp to
            375°F and bake for 11-12 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
