        <li>
            In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce (1 tbsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), rice vinegar (2 tbsp), sugar (3 tbsp) and water (3 tbsp) and mix thoroughly.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat up a wok and pour in the white sesame seeds (28.3 g) and lower the heat. Stir around constantly using a spatula.
            After 30 seconds, turn off the heat and stir for another 30 seconds. Once the seeds are golden brown, transfer to a plate or bowl and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat oil up on medium-low heat, about 3 cups.
        </li>

        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour (4 tbsp) and cornstarch (3 tbsp).
            Add the baking powder (2 tsp) and salt (0.50 tsp) and stir to combine.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the water (6.5 tbsp). Do this slowly and gradually a few tablespoons at a time, then stir to combine.
            Add a bit more and mix again, until all of the water has been added to the batter.
            The batter should be loose, but not too thin. Add more or less water as needed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Crack and beat 1 large egg, adding half of it to the batter. Reserve the rest of the egg for later use.
            Finally, add the oil (1 tsp) and mix thoroughly to combine.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cut 340g (12 oz) of chicken breast.

            white pepper (1 tsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp) and water (1 tbsp). Mix the chicken and marinade ingredients together thoroughly.
            Add half of the reserved beaten egg into the chicken (so you use 0.25 of the large egg).
        </li>

        <li>
            In another small bowl, combine the cornstarch (1 tsp) and water (3 tbsp) and stir to combine. Set aside.

            For sauce, add 1 tsp of oil to wok, then add garlic/pepper and fry until aromatic.
            Add sauce and stir for 30 seconds until hot, turn to low heat, then add slurry and stir for a minute,
            adding more water if too thick (should be like thick water).
